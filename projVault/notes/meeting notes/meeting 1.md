## prep
##### core idea refresher
core idea is a method for determining **human difficulty** for arbitrary minesweeper fields.
###### stretch goals
- application of this to minesweeper techniques learned and documented by minesweeper experts,
- application to arbitrary graph minesweeper, investigating how difficulty of problem classes change with more complex graphs

##### new progress
research: general refresh on CP as a whole, NP completeness, hardness. also specifically minesweeper's NP-completeness and reduction to SAT.

heard that minimum unsatisfiable sets are closely related to how humans perceive difficulty.
- ==TODO==: find and read papers on this.
- on that note, I still need to look at sokoban. (was too tunnelvisioned on the mz model below..)

partial progress on a minesweeper minizinc model
- was planning to run it on different problems to see if there's correlation between amount of "turns" it needs and how hard the puzzle feels

##### questions
1. should I work on the interim report throughout, or should I "figure it out" first,
   and then write the report once the details are settled?

2. what is semester 1?
   I'm guessing it's not like last year where the general expectation was for a working proof of concept by the first semester?
   focusing just on interim report and proof of concept/feasibility instead.

## meeting outcomes
make pseudo-deadlines
take notes on papers read
github to track work
